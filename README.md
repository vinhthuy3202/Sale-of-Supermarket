Product Performance:
Accessories drive nearly half of sales (47.5%), indicating high demand or high margin in this category.

Clothing is strong at ~38%, while Shoes are a smaller share (~14%) despite having many subcategories (Running, Soccer, Swim, Training, etc.).

Customer & Segment Focus:
Category tree includes Men, Women, Kids, Originals, Running, Soccer, etc.

Essentials appear in the filtered list, likely representing core/basic items with steady demand.

Peaks in January (post-holiday, New Year sales) and July (mid-year, summer sales).

3. Business Insights & Recommendations
Maximize Accessories Growth
Since accessories are nearly 50% of sales, consider expanding this line (more styles, promotions, cross-selling with clothing/shoes).

Boost Shoes Category
Despite many subcategories (Running, Soccer, etc.), shoes are only ~14% of sales.
→ Review pricing, marketing, or inventory in this segment.

Leverage Seasonal Peaks
Plan marketing campaigns and stock increases ahead of January and July.
Use promotions in low-sales months to balance revenue.

Segment-Based Marketing
Use the category hierarchy to target specific segments:

Men’s accessories, Women’s clothing, Kids’ essentials, etc.

Payment Method Optimization
Since all methods are equally used, ensure smooth UX for each. Consider incentives for lower-cost payment methods to reduce transaction fees.
