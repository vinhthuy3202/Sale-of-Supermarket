# Sale-of-Supermarket
analyzed three core datasets—sales transactions, customers, and products—to understand how the business is performing, who their customers are, what they buy, and where future sales are heading.

To uncover these patterns, I:

  Cleaned and merged datasets (customer, products, sales) using pandas.

  Grouped sales data by state and calculated total revenue.

  Created a horizontal bar chart using matplotlib and seaborn to rank states by sales.

  Analyzed the skewness of sales distribution and identified outliers.
